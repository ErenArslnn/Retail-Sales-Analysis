Retail Sales Analysis Project

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes weekly sales trends for a retail store using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to explore how various factors impact sales performance and to gain insights for decision-making.

All of the content issued in this project is taken from kaggle page of MANJEET SINGH. You can find the link for all details about datasets from below.

📂 Datasets Used

This project uses three datasets:

stores data-set.csv - Information about different stores such as their size, type and name.

Features data set.csv - Additional details such as markdowns, fuel prices, and consumer trends.

sales data-set.csv - Weekly sales data for different departments.

🔍 Analysis Steps

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (except for Markdown columns).

Merged datasets for comprehensive analysis.

Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics using df.describe() and df.info().

Correlation analysis using df.corr().

Visualizations (boxplots, histograms, and trend graphs) to understand sales distribution.

Sales Trends Analysis

Identified peak and low sales periods.

Examined seasonal patterns and external factors affecting sales.

Compared sales performance across different timelines.

Next Steps: Data Visualization

Moving to Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.

Creating reports to showcase key insights.

📌 Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook for coding and visualization

Power BI / Tableau (planned for final visualization)

Git & GitHub for version control
